# News-Conversation-Network


Moved everything from [old repo](https://github.com/shoumikchow/News-Conversation-Network/) to here because the old repo was becoming unmanageable due to bad code and bad file management.

The paper that was accepted in the [Machine Learning for Development workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ml4d-nips-2018/) at NeurIPS 2018 can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03632).
